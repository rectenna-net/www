[OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o: The A2O core was a follow-on to A2I, written in Verilog, and supported a lower thread count than A2I, but higher performance per thread, using out-of-order execution (register renaming, reservation stations, completion buffer) and a store queue. It is now being updated for compliancy and integration into open projects.](https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o)
