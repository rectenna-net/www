[OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o: The A2O core was a follow-on to A2I, written in Verilog, and supported a lower thread count than A2I, but higher performance per thread, using out-of-order execution (register renaming, reservation stations, completion buffer) and a store queue. It is now being updated for compliancy and integration into open projects.](https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o)




[LEctenna Challenge](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/STEM/LEctenna-Challenge/)

> **What is LEctenna and how does it work?**   
>  
> 
> LEctenna, short for Light Emitting Diode (LED) Rectifying Antenna, features a fast-switching Schottky diode paired with a standard LED together in parallel, placed in a test tube to isolate the wires. In electrical engineering, putting components in parallel means connecting both of their pairs leads together. Isolation means they are separated from other nearby objects so other electrical effects don’t interfere with your circuit.
> 
> While simple in its construction, LEctenna acts to rectify incoming radio signals into DC electricity that lights up the LED. This happens because as electromagnetic waves pass through the LEctenna device, they cause the charge distribution to flip between opposite sides of the diodes. Typically this would create a net zero voltage across the LED, preventing it from lighting up. But because of the Schottky diode’s fast-switching at 2.4 GHz (the same frequency as wi-fi) and low capacitance, this results in clipping that allows for a net positive voltage across the LED, allowing it to light up.
> 
> One of the most interesting applications of the power beaming LEctenna demonstrates is in space-based solar power. Using this wireless power technology, we may someday be able to harvest solar energy in space and beam it down for use on Earth. This would allow us to collect solar power day or night, and in any kind of weather. Sunlight is also brighter in space than anywhere on Earth. This technology could be an incredible option in the future for providing clean energy to power the world.




[List of WLAN channels - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels)

> The 802.11 standard provides several distinct radio frequency bands for use in Wi-Fi communications: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, 5.9 GHz, 6 GHz and 60 GHz. Each range is divided into a multitude of channels. In the standards, channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing within a band (except in the 60 GHz band, where they are 2.16 GHz apart), and the number linearly relates to the centre frequency of the channel. Although channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing, transmitters generally occupy at least 20 MHz, and standards allow for channels to be bonded together to form wider channels for faster throughput.



[Wi-Fi 6 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6)


> **IEEE 802.11ax**, officially marketed by the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance "Wi-Fi Alliance") as **Wi-Fi 6** (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6#cite_note-generational-8) and **Wi-Fi 6E** (6 GHz),[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6#cite_note-6e-9) is an [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE") standard for wireless local-area networks ([WLANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLAN "WLAN")) and the successor of [802.11ac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11ac "802.11ac"). It is also known as _High Efficiency_ Wi-Fi, for the overall improvements to Wi-Fi 6 clients in dense environments.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6#cite_note-atutorial-10) It is designed to operate in [license-exempt bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band "ISM radio band") between 1 and 7.125 GHz, including the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands already in common use as well as the much wider [6 GHz band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#6GHz "List of WLAN channels") (e.g. 5.925–7.125 GHz in the US, a [band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing) "Bandwidth (signal processing)") 1.200 GHz wide).[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6#cite_note-FCC_Order_2020-04-11)
