[OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o: The A2O core was a follow-on to A2I, written in Verilog, and supported a lower thread count than A2I, but higher performance per thread, using out-of-order execution (register renaming, reservation stations, completion buffer) and a store queue. It is now being updated for compliancy and integration into open projects.](https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/a2o)

> **What is LEctenna and how does it work?**   
>  
> 
> LEctenna, short for Light Emitting Diode (LED) Rectifying Antenna, features a fast-switching Schottky diode paired with a standard LED together in parallel, placed in a test tube to isolate the wires. In electrical engineering, putting components in parallel means connecting both of their pairs leads together. Isolation means they are separated from other nearby objects so other electrical effects don’t interfere with your circuit.
> 
> While simple in its construction, LEctenna acts to rectify incoming radio signals into DC electricity that lights up the LED. This happens because as electromagnetic waves pass through the LEctenna device, they cause the charge distribution to flip between opposite sides of the diodes. Typically this would create a net zero voltage across the LED, preventing it from lighting up. But because of the Schottky diode’s fast-switching at 2.4 GHz (the same frequency as wi-fi) and low capacitance, this results in clipping that allows for a net positive voltage across the LED, allowing it to light up.

> One of the most interesting applications of the power beaming LEctenna demonstrates is in space-based solar power. Using this wireless power technology, we may someday be able to harvest solar energy in space and beam it down for use on Earth. This would allow us to collect solar power day or night, and in any kind of weather. Sunlight is also brighter in space than anywhere on Earth. This technology could be an incredible option in the future for providing clean energy to power the world.
